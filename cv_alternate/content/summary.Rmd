## Personal Summary {.summary}
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Social Investigation and a Research Fellow of Nuffield College, University of Oxford. My primary research focuses on how characteristics of communities impact crime, social control, and their consequences. I approach this topic with methods from demography, computational social science, and causal inference.
