## Personal Summary {.summary}
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Social Investigation and a Research Fellow of Nuffield College in the University of Oxford. I conduct theory-driven research on the ways communities respond to crime and the consequences of those responses using methods from demography, computational social science, and causal inference.
