# ccl_cv

This is the repository for my curriculum vitae based on the lovely [pagedown-cv](https://github.com/ulyngs/pagedown-cv/) by [Ulrik Lyngs](https://github.com/ulyngs). It has been substantially modified to the to produce a minimalist look. If you want to create something similar, I would recommend forking off of [pagedown-cv](https://github.com/ulyngs/pagedown-cv/) to avoid inheriting odd behavior I have inserted.
